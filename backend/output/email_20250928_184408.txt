Subject: Cognitive Assessment Results - Thank You

Dear User,

Thank you for completing the cognitive assessment. We appreciate you taking the time to prioritize your cognitive health.

The results indicate potential areas for further investigation, particularly in the areas of memory, executive function, and cognitive processing speed. Specifically, we observed low scores in the Memory Game and Image Recall, and a Stroop Colour score suggesting mild difficulty. The speech analysis was limited due to a short audio sample.

It's important to remember that this assessment is not a diagnosis.

DISCLAIMER: It is a test done by AI; if the score is too high it is suggested to consult a doctor immediately, if not then also it is better to meet a doctor.

We recommend consulting with a qualified healthcare professional, such as a neuropsychologist or cognitive neurologist, for a comprehensive evaluation and personalized advice. Further speech and language evaluation with longer samples can be considered.

Taking proactive steps to understand your cognitive health is commendable.

Sincerely,

The Patient Engagement Team
