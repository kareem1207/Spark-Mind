This cognitive assessment reveals potential areas of concern, particularly in memory and executive function. The Memory Game score was a low 1, and Image Recall (acting as a proxy for Object-Purpose Matching) was 0. The Stroop Colour score of 29 suggests mild difficulty with cognitive processing speed. Speech analysis was unreliable due to a very short audio sample (1.86 seconds) consisting almost entirely of pauses (1.86 seconds, 50.0% pause density), leading to anomalous metrics (e.g. 75.17 words/sec fluency). Sentiment analysis indicated a positive sentiment (67.288) from the phrase "Ok, bye bye," but its reliability is limited. Further comprehensive evaluation is recommended to investigate these findings.

**Key Highlights:**

*   Memory Game score: 1 (suggests poor short-term memory)
*   Image Recall score: 0 (limited interpretability due to acting as proxy)
*   Stroop Colour score: 29 (indicates mild difficulty with cognitive processing speed)
*   Total Time (Speech): 1.86 seconds
*   Total Pause Time (Speech): 1.86 seconds
*   Pause Density (Speech): 50.0% (anomalous, unreliable speech metrics)
*   Sentiment Analysis: Positive, 67.288 weighted score

**Next Steps:**

*   Comprehensive Cognitive Assessment by a neuropsychologist or cognitive neurologist.
*   Speech and Language Evaluation to assess speech fluency and language skills.
*   Neurological Examination to rule out underlying neurological conditions.
*   Repeat Digital Cognitive Testing with longer speech samples.
*   Consider additional testing (blood tests, neuroimaging).

Overall Cognitive Risk: Mild
