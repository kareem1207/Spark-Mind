Subject: Your Cognitive Assessment Results

Dear User,

Thank you for completing the cognitive assessment. We appreciate your participation.

The results indicate potential difficulties in several areas. Specifically, the memory game score suggests a possible short-term memory impairment. The Stroop Colour score indicates a potential challenge with inhibitory control. Sentiment analysis suggests a shift towards negative sentiment, and speech analysis revealed high pause density. Please note that the speech fluency calculation may be unreliable and needs further validation.

It's important to remember that this assessment is not a diagnosis.

If you have concerns, we recommend consulting with a healthcare professional for a comprehensive evaluation. Further investigation may include a neuropsychological evaluation, speech and language assessment, and mood assessment.

DISCLAIMER: It is a test done by AI; if the score is too high it is suggested to consult a doctor immediately, if not then also it is better to meet a doctor.

Taking proactive steps towards understanding your cognitive health is a positive move.

Sincerely,
