This cognitive assessment reveals potential concerns based on speech analysis. While cognitive game scores (Stroop Colour: 0, Memory Recall: 0, Object-Purpose Matching: 0) are unavailable, speech analysis indicates elevated pause density (46.53%) and filler frequency (9.09%), alongside lexical diversity of 61.82%. Sentiment is neutral (Weighted Sentiment Score: 62.06, probabilities: \[0.041, 0.058, 0.707, 0.144, 0.049]). The heuristic cognitive risk is categorized as "mild" with a probability of 0.378, primarily driven by speech patterns. Further comprehensive evaluation is recommended.

**Key Highlights:**

*   **Stroop Colour:** 0 (game not implemented)
*   **Memory Recall:** 0 (game not implemented)
*   **Matching Object-Purpose:** 0 (game not implemented)
*   **Total Time:** 18.8 seconds
*   **Total Pause Time:** 16.36 seconds
*   **Pause Density:** 46.53%
*   **Repeated Words:** 14
*   **Filler Words:** 5
*   **Filler Frequency:** 9.09%
*   **Unique Words:** 34
*   **Lexical Diversity:** 61.82%
*   **Speech Fluency:** 56.17 words/sec (likely incorrect)
*   **Sentiment Label:** Neutral
*   **Sentiment Probabilities:** \[0.041, 0.058, 0.707, 0.144, 0.049]
*   **Weighted Sentiment Score:** 62.06
*   **Heuristic Cognitive Risk Category:** Mild
*   **Heuristic Cognitive Risk Probability:** 0.378

**Next Steps:**

*   Implement and analyze the Stroop Colour, Memory Recall, and Object-Purpose Matching tasks.
*   Consult with a neurologist or neuropsychologist for a thorough clinical evaluation.
*   Monitor speech patterns for changes in fluency, pause frequency, and lexical diversity.
*   Explore potential underlying factors contributing to speech patterns.
