Dear User,

Thank you for completing the cognitive self-assessment.

The initial results suggest potential areas for further exploration, specifically regarding speech fluency and word retrieval. We observed a higher pause density, filler frequency, and repeated words during the speech analysis, which could indicate word-finding challenges. While the overall sentiment was predominantly neutral, these speech-related findings warrant careful consideration. Please note that data from the Stroop Colour, Memory Recall, and Object-Purpose Matching tasks were incomplete.

This assessment is not a substitute for a comprehensive evaluation by qualified healthcare professionals. If you have concerns, we encourage you to consult with a neurologist and seek a formal speech and language evaluation to gain a clearer understanding of your cognitive profile.

**DISCLAIMER:** It is a test done by AI; if the score is too high, it is suggested to consult a doctor immediately; if not, it is still better to meet a doctor.

Taking proactive steps to understand and support your cognitive health is a worthwhile endeavor.

Sincerely,
