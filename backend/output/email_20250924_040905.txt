Subject: Thank You for Completing Your Cognitive Assessment

Dear User,

Thank you for taking the time to complete your cognitive assessment. We appreciate your engagement in this process.

Based on the data collected, we observed the following: The cognitive game scores for Stroop Colour, Memory Game, and Matching Object-Purpose are currently incomplete. The speech analysis indicated a notable pause density, a filler frequency, and a lexical diversity. The sentiment analysis presented a neutral emotional tone.

Please remember, this assessment is not a diagnosis, and the results are intended for informational purposes only. It is crucial to consult with qualified healthcare professionals for a comprehensive evaluation and personalized recommendations. If you have any concerns about your cognitive health, we strongly encourage you to seek professional medical advice.

Taking proactive steps towards understanding and supporting your cognitive well-being is a positive and empowering choice.

DISCLAIMER: It is a test done by AI; if the score is too high it is suggested to consult a doctor immediately, if not then also it is better to meet a doctor.
