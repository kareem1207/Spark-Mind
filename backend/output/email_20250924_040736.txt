Subject: Cognitive Assessment Results - Thank You

Dear User,

Thank you for completing the cognitive assessment. We appreciate your participation.

This assessment analyzed speech patterns and cognitive skills, though some game scores are currently placeholders. Key metrics included speech fluency, pause density, lexical diversity, and sentiment analysis. Your results showed a high pause density, suggesting potential challenges in speech fluency, and an unusually high speech fluency rate that requires validation. Sentiment analysis indicated a neutral overall sentiment.

Please remember, this assessment is AI-driven and not a substitute for professional medical advice. If you have concerns about your cognitive health, it is important to consult with a qualified healthcare professional.

DISCLAIMER: It is a test done by AI; if the score is too high it is suggested to consult a doctor immediately, if not then also it is better to meet a doctor.

Taking proactive steps to understand your cognitive health is a positive move. We hope this assessment provides helpful insights.

Sincerely,

The Patient Engagement Team
