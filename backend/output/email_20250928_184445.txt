Dear User,

Thank you for completing the cognitive assessment. We appreciate your time and effort.

The assessment suggests potential areas of concern in memory and speech. Specifically, we observed lower scores in the Memory Game and Image Recall tasks. Additionally, speech analysis indicated a high pause density and limited lexical diversity, although this was based on a very short speech sample. The Stroop Colour score requires further context for interpretation. On a positive note, sentiment analysis showed a positive outlook.

These findings do not constitute a diagnosis, but we recommend further evaluation to gain a more comprehensive understanding. We suggest scheduling a neuropsychological evaluation, providing a detailed medical history, and considering a speech-language pathology consultation. Repeating the cognitive games after familiarization might also be beneficial.

*DISCLAIMER: It is a test done by AI; if the score is too high it is suggested to consult a doctor immediately, if not then also it is better to meet a doctor.*

Taking proactive steps to understand and support your cognitive health is a valuable investment in your overall well-being.

Sincerely,

The Cognitive Assessment Team
