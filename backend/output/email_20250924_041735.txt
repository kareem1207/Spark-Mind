Subject: Thank you for completing the Cognitive Assessment

Dear User,

Thank you for participating in our cognitive assessment. We appreciate your time and effort.

Based on the data collected, the cognitive game scores for Stroop Colour, Memory Recall, and Object-Purpose Matching are currently unavailable. However, the speech analysis indicates a higher pause density and filler word frequency, with a measured lexical diversity. The overall sentiment expressed was neutral. Our system categorized the heuristic cognitive risk as mild, primarily based on these speech patterns.

Please remember that this assessment is not a medical diagnosis. It's an AI-driven heuristic estimate intended to provide a general overview. If you have any concerns based on these results, we strongly recommend consulting with a healthcare professional for a comprehensive clinical evaluation. It's always best to discuss your cognitive health with a qualified doctor.

Taking proactive steps to understand and manage your cognitive well-being is a positive choice.

Sincerely,

The Patient Engagement Team
