Subject: Cognitive Assessment Results

Dear [User],

Thank you for completing the cognitive assessment. We appreciate you taking the time to prioritize your cognitive health.

The assessment indicates a mild overall cognitive risk level, suggesting some potential areas of concern that warrant further investigation. Specifically, the assessment highlighted potential difficulties with memory recall and image recall. Speech analysis revealed a high pause density in one audio file, and the Stroop Colour test results also indicated an area for review. Sentiment analysis of the same file registered a "positive" sentiment.

To ensure accurate results, we recommend repeating the assessment. We also strongly encourage you to share these results with a healthcare provider for further evaluation.

*DISCLAIMER: This is a test done by AI; if the score is too high it is suggested to consult a doctor immediately, if not then also it is better to meet a doctor.*

Taking proactive steps for your cognitive well-being is commendable.

Sincerely,
