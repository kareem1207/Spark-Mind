This cognitive assessment, conducted on October 26, 2023, suggests possible difficulties with memory function based on digital game scores and speech analysis. Specifically, the memory game score was 1 and the image recall score was 0, indicating potential short and long term memory challenges. Speech analysis revealed a very high pause density of 50%, which could indicate word-finding or processing difficulties. The Stroop Colour test score of 40 suggests average cognitive flexibility. The sentiment analysis was neutral at 45.078. An extremely high speech fluency calculation of 78.57 words/second is likely an error. Further evaluation is recommended to understand the potential memory and speech-related concerns better.

**Key Highlights:**

*   **Memory Game:** Score of 1, indicating potential short-term memory difficulties.
*   **Image Recall:** Score of 0, indicating potential long-term memory difficulties.
*   **Stroop Colour:** Score of 40, within the normal range for cognitive flexibility and attention.
*   **Pause Density:** 50%, suggesting potential word-finding or cognitive processing delays.
*   **Filler Frequency:** 14.29%, indicating a moderate use of filler words.
*   **Lexical Diversity:** 100%, potentially skewed due to a short sample size.
*   **Speech Fluency:** 78.57 words/second, likely an error in calculation.
*   **Sentiment Analysis:** Neutral sentiment (45.078).

**Next Steps:**

*   Schedule a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation.
*   Consult with a neurologist to rule out underlying neurological conditions.
*   Repeat the cognitive games and speech recording to establish a baseline, ensuring accurate audio capture.
*   Review potential confounding factors like medications, sleep, or mood.
*   Consider speech therapy if speech analysis continues to show language-related difficulties.

**Report Summary:** Elevated
