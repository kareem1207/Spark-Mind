**Summary**

This cognitive assessment, using digital tasks and speech analysis, aims to identify cognitive strengths and weaknesses. While game scores are currently placeholders (zeros), speech analysis reveals potential challenges in speech fluency, indicated by a high pause density of 46.53%, 14 repeated words, and filler word usage of 9.09%. Lexical diversity is measured at 61.82%. The speech fluency rate of 56.17 words/sec is unusually high and requires validation. Sentiment analysis shows a neutral overall sentiment (70.75%) with a weighted score of 62.06, but includes small probabilities for negative sentiments (4.13% negative, 14.42% somewhat negative). Further evaluation and validation are needed, especially regarding the speech fluency rate.

**Key Highlights**

*   **Stroop Colour:** Score: 0 (Placeholder)
*   **Memory Recall:** Score: 0 (Placeholder)
*   **Object-Purpose Matching:** Score: 0 (Placeholder)
*   **Total time:** 18.8 seconds
*   **Total pause time:** 16.36 seconds
*   **Pause density:** 46.53% (High, suggests potential speech fluency issues)
*   **Repeated words:** 14 (Suggests difficulty with word retrieval)
*   **Filler words:** 5 (9.09%)
*   **Unique words:** 34
*   **Lexical diversity:** 61.82%
*   **Speech fluency:** 56.17 words/sec (Unusually high, needs validation)
*   **Overall sentiment:** Neutral (70.75%)
*   **Weighted score:** 62.06
*   **Sentiment probabilities:** negative (4.13%), somewhat negative (14.42%), positive (5.76%), somewhat positive (4.95%).

**Next Steps**

*   **Repeat the speech task:** Obtain a repeat recording and analysis to validate the high pause density and speech fluency measurements.
*   **Implement cognitive games:** Administer the Stroop Colour, Memory Recall, and Object-Purpose Matching tasks.
*   **Consult a speech-language pathologist:** Seek professional evaluation of language skills given potential language processing difficulties.
*   **Monitor sentiment:** Observe for any changes in emotional well-being.
*   **Consider neurological evaluation:** If cognitive concerns persist, pursue comprehensive neurological testing.
