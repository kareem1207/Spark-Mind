Dear User,

Thank you for completing the cognitive assessment. We appreciate you taking the time to prioritize your cognitive health.

The assessment indicates a mixed profile. Strengths were noted in memory recall. We also observed potential areas for further investigation regarding visual memory, executive function, speech patterns and language formulation. Specifically, the assessment highlighted your memory recall score, image recall score, Stroop Colour score, pause densities in speech, lexical diversity, and the presence of repeated and filler words in one of the audio files.

It's important to consult with a healthcare professional for a comprehensive cognitive evaluation to explore these areas further. Detailed neuropsychological testing, a review of your medical history, and consideration of lifestyle factors are also recommended.

*DISCLAIMER: It is a test done by AI; if the score is too high it is suggested to consult a doctor immediately, if not then also it is better to meet a doctor.*

Taking proactive steps towards understanding your cognitive health is commendable. We hope this assessment provides valuable insights.

Sincerely,
