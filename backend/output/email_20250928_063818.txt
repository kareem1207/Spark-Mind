Subject: Thank you for completing the Cognitive Assessment

Dear [User],

Thank you for taking the time to complete our cognitive assessment. We appreciate your participation.

Based on your results, we observed relative strengths in visual memory (Image Recall). However, the assessment also indicated potential areas for improvement in short-term memory (Memory Game) and processing speed (Stroop Colour). Additionally, speech patterns suggest possible challenges, and the sentiment analysis indicated a negative mood.

Specifically, your Image Recall score suggests reasonable visual memory. Your Memory Game score suggests potential short-term memory concerns. Your Stroop Colour score suggests slower cognitive processing speed. Your speech patterns, in terms of pause densities, lexical diversity, and filler word usage, indicate possible speech-related difficulties. Finally, your sentiment score suggests a prevailing negative mood.

Remember, this assessment provides only a snapshot, and a comprehensive evaluation by a healthcare professional is highly recommended.

DISCLAIMER: It is a test done by AI; if the score is too high it is suggested to consult a doctor immediately, if not then also it is better to meet a doctor.

We encourage you to discuss these results with your doctor or other qualified healthcare provider to determine the best course of action. Proactive attention to your cognitive health can make a significant difference.

Sincerely,

The [Company Name] Team
