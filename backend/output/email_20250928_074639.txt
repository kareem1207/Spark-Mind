Subject: Cognitive Assessment Results

Dear User,

Thank you for completing the cognitive assessment. We appreciate you taking the time to prioritize your cognitive health.

Our analysis indicates potential areas for further evaluation. Specifically, the Memory Game and Image Recall scores suggest possible memory-related difficulties. The Stroop Colour test result may point to challenges with cognitive interference. A negative sentiment was detected, but it is difficult to interpret this result due to the very short speech sample length.

It is important to note the strengths observed, including high Lexical Diversity and speech fluency. However, these are also difficult to interpret due to the short speech sample length.

Given these findings, we recommend consulting with a healthcare professional for a comprehensive evaluation. Further neuropsychological testing and a longer speech sample analysis might also be beneficial.

*DISCLAIMER: It is a test done by AI; if the score is too high it is suggested to consult a doctor immediately, if not then also it is better to meet a doctor.*

Taking proactive steps towards cognitive wellness is a valuable investment in your overall health and well-being.

Sincerely,

The Patient Engagement Team
