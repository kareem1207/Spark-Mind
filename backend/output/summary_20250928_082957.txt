This cognitive assessment reveals incomplete data due to missing scores for the Stroop Colour and Image Recall games. The memory game score is 1, suggesting a basic level of memory recall. However, speech analysis results show unusually high pause density (50%) and speech fluency (90 words/sec), raising concerns about the accuracy of the speech analysis pipeline, along with lexical diversity being calculated at 100% based on only 3 words, and the sentiment analysis indicates a neutral sentiment with a weighted score of 59.39. A definitive cognitive risk assessment is not possible with the current dataset due to these data limitations.

**Key Highlights:**

*   Memory Game Score: 1

*   Repeated Words: 0
*   Filler Words: 0
*   Filler Frequency: 0%
*   Unique Words: 3
*   Lexical Diversity: 100%
*   Speech Fluency: 90 words/sec
*   Sentiment Label: Neutral
*   Sentiment Probabilities: Negative: 0.0346, Somewhat negative: 0.0857, Neutral: 0.7871, Somewhat positive: 0.0607, Positive: 0.0318
*   Weighted Sentiment Score: 59.39

**Next Steps:**

*   Implement the Stroop Colour and Image Recall game modules.
*   Verify and recalibrate the speech analysis pipeline for accuracy.
*   Repeat the cognitive testing with complete data.
*   Consult a healthcare provider for a comprehensive cognitive evaluation.
*   Consider comprehensive neuropsychological testing if concerns persist.
